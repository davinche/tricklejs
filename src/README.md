# TrickleJS

TrickleJS is a partial implementation of Dart's [StreamController][sc] and [Stream][stream].
The purpose is to provide a library with a similar interface to Dart streams such that one could start
build applications using things like the [BloC][bloc] architecture in JS without diving into the hairy world of [Reactive Extensions][rxjs].

[stream]: https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.8.2/dart-async/Stream-class.html
[bloc]: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options
